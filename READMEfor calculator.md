#problem: You need to create a simple calculator using GUI programing.
The graphical interface should allow the user to enter a number in a text field and either add it to or subtract it from a running total.
The running total should always be displayed. The user should be able to resit the running total to zero using a button Resit. 
The user will need to input a new value and then either press the button “+” to add the value to the running total or press “-” button to decrement the value in the entry from the running total. 
Each time the buttons “+” or “-” are pressed, the entry will be cleared and the running total will be updated. 
The GUI for the calculator should look like the following:

#step 1: importing tkinter for GUI interface
step2: give a lebel name and entry fied and button then given command option at the button
step3: create a fucntion for doing addition, subtraciton and reset
step4: here running total is not a label or entry so we are converting that into a label by using Stringvar() keyword
step5: check that if it reset all varaibles value equals to zero so the running total should start from zero
